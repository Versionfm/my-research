This study examines the factors associated with AI adoption in day-to-day professional 
activities through a binary logistic regression model estimated on a national Portuguese survey. 
The dependent variable is a dichotomous indicator of whether the respondent uses AI at work. 
Explanatory variables include gender, age, education, region, sector of activity, coding-related 
tasks, self-assessed AI knowledge, perceived ease of AI in daily life, and attitudes toward risk and 
benefit. Model diagnostics confirm the adequacy of the specification, with perceptual variables 
demonstrating the strongest predictive capacity. Higher perceived knowledge and agreement that 
AI simplifies daily tasks significantly increase the odds of adoption. In contrast, socio
demographic variables and regional differences show weak or null effects. The results indicate that 
AI usage at work is driven primarily by subjective perceptions and familiarity, offering 
evidence-based guidance for skills development and organizational strategies aimed at 
strengthening AI readiness.
